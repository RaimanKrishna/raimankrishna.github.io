                <h2>Part I: Aim </h2>
                <p><b>Overview:</b> p>Swachh Survekshan (Cleanliness Survey), a flagship initiative under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), is an annual assessment designed to evaluate the performance of Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) and states across various sanitation and cleanliness parameters. The survey acts as a benchmark for monitoring urban sanitation, solid waste management, and citizens' perception of cleanliness, driving healthy competition among cities and states to improve their cleanliness standards.

                                      However, recurring discrepancies between data reported by State Management Information Systems (MIS) and the survey results have raised concerns about the transparency and accuracy of the assessment process. Such inconsistencies risk undermining the credibility of the initiative and may hinder the effectiveness of urban sanitation efforts.

                                      This project aims to identify and analyze these discrepancies, highlighting areas of concern and proposing solutions to strengthen the credibility, transparency, and impact of urban sanitation initiatives under the Swachh Bharat Mission (Clean India Mission).</p>
                
                 <p><b>Data:</b> Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban), Swachh Survekshan (Cleanliness Survey) 2023, State Urban Development Departments, Census of India (2011).</p>
 
                <p><b>Introduction to Swachh Survekshan and Marking Criteria</b></p>
                </p>Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM): Launched in 2014, SBM is India's largest cleanliness drive aimed at eliminating open defecation, improving solid waste management, and ensuring sustainable sanitation infrastructure.
                   Swachh Survekshan: Conducted by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA), Swachh Survekshan assesses ULBs and states across various metrics, such as: Door-to-door waste collection, Source segregation of waste and Scientific processing and disposal of waste.

          State Management Information Systems (MIS):
          State MIS platforms are designed to provide real-time data on the performance of ULBs. The data is submitted by states themselves and serves as a critical input for central assessments.<p>

        <h2>Part II: State-wise Rankings in Swachh Survekshan</h2>     
        <p><b>Performace of States in Swachh Survekshan:</b>The rankings of states in Swachh Survekshan 2023 reflect their performance in achieving cleanliness and sanitation goals, evaluated across parameters such as waste management, infrastructure, and citizen engagement. States like Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Maharashtra, which scored above 4,500 marks, consistently performed well due to strong policy implementation and active citizen participation. Mid-performing states such as Punjab and Rajasthan scored between 3,500 to 4,000 marks, showcasing progress but highlighting gaps in infrastructure and resources. Low-performing states like Bihar and West Bengal, with scores below 3,000 marks, face challenges such as inconsistent data reporting, limited funding, and low awareness. These rankings not only encourage competitive federalism but also highlight areas needing targeted interventions to ensure equitable progress..</p>

<!-- Part III: Data Discrepancies -->

        <h2>Part III: Data Discrepancies </h2>
        <p> This section highlights the significant discrepancies in data reported by states through the Management Information System (MIS) and the results observed in the Swachh Survekshan 2023 cleanliness survey. The discrepancies are presented across three critical parameters.</p>
        <p>The Key Areas of Discrepancy in Swachh Survekshan 2023 highlight significant gaps between data reported in the Management Information System (MIS) and on-ground survey findings. For door-to-door waste collection, states often claim coverage exceeding 95% in their MIS, but Swachh Survekshan data reveals much lower figures, especially in smaller Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), due to inadequate infrastructure, workforce shortages, and irregular collection schedules. Similarly, in source segregation of waste, states report segregation levels of 90% or higher, while survey results show actual segregation levels often falling below 60%, pointing to insufficient awareness campaigns, inadequate infrastructure like separate bins, and weak monitoring mechanisms. Lastly, waste generation figures are frequently underreported in MIS to meet efficiency targets, but Swachh Survekshan findings consistently indicate significantly higher waste generation, exposing gaps in tracking mechanisms and inconsistent data collection practices. These discrepancies reflect systemic challenges that hinder effective planning, resource allocation, and accountability in waste management.</p>

                <p>History shows that modern sewage systems in large cities like London and New York transformed public health by reducing diseases. Public health policy in India should prioritize improving sewage collection and treatment systems in urban and semi-urban areas to meet the goals of becoming an upper-middle-income country in the next decade.</p>
