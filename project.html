           This page acts as my project page for the PP434: Automated Data Visualisation for Policymaking course, part of the MPP programme at LSE. 
            Aims: The project aims to analyze key indicators of the Swachh Survekshan survey to assess the performance of urban local bodies (ULBs) in sanitation and waste management. The primary objectives include Understanding trends in sanitation performance across cities and identifying top-performing and underperforming ULBs.

                <h2>Part I:Ranking of States in Swachh Survekshan</h2>
                <p><b>Objective:</b> This project examines the relationship between sanitary-sewage system quality and malnutrition as well as mortality outcomes in children under five across Indian states. </p>
                <p><b>Dependent Variables:</b>
                    <ul>
<li>A child is said to be stunted when the “child’s height-for-age Z score is less than -2 standard deviations (SD) from the median reference population”. This index is an indicator of “linear growth retardation and growth deficits”. A stunted child is considered short for their age.</li> 
<li>A child is said to be underweight i.e. suffering from “acute and chronic malnutrition if their weight-for-age is below minus 2 standard deviations from the median reference population. </li>
<li>A child whose weight-for-height Z score is less than -2 SD from the median reference population are thin (wasted) for their height and are acutely malnourished.</li> 
<li>Under-five mortality, which is defined as the number of deaths per 1000 live births for children less than 5 years old.</li>

                <h2>Part II: Child Mortality Rates in India</h2>
                <p>Under-five mortality (U5MR) is defined as the number of deaths per 1000 live births for children less than 5 years old. 
                Using data from the National Family Health Survey 4 (2019-20), this chart shows the wide variations in under-five mortality rates across different states with southern states like Kerala having lower mortality rates while northern states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar having above national average mortality.</p>

            <h2>Part III: Policy Response - Swachh Bharat Mission for increasing sanitation access across India.</h2>
                <p> History shows that installation of modern sewage systems in large cities like London and New York transformed the health of nations, by eliminating the spread on many diseases that thrive on poor sanitation and sewage. Attention of public health policy should shift to improving the sewage collection, treatment systems in urban, semi-urban and semi-rural areas of each state. Given that our goal is to become a upper middle income country in 5-7 years, and a high income country in 25 years, we need to develop State level grids for collecting, processing and recycling sewage and solid waste in the next ten years.</p>

                <p> Improved sanitation- private and shared, therefore reduces child malnutrition, which in turn reduces child mortality across Indian States.</p>
