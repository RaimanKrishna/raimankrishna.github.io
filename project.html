                <h2>Part I: Aim </h2>
                <p><b>Overview:</b> p>Swachh Survekshan (Cleanliness Survey), a flagship initiative under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), is an annual assessment designed to evaluate the performance of Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) and states across various sanitation and cleanliness parameters. The survey acts as a benchmark for monitoring urban sanitation, solid waste management, and citizens' perception of cleanliness, driving healthy competition among cities and states to improve their cleanliness standards.

                                      However, recurring discrepancies between data reported by State Management Information Systems (MIS) and the survey results have raised concerns about the transparency and accuracy of the assessment process. Such inconsistencies risk undermining the credibility of the initiative and may hinder the effectiveness of urban sanitation efforts.

                                      This project aims to identify and analyze these discrepancies, highlighting areas of concern and proposing solutions to strengthen the credibility, transparency, and impact of urban sanitation initiatives under the Swachh Bharat Mission (Clean India Mission).</p>
                
                 <p><b>Data:</b> Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban), Swachh Survekshan (Cleanliness Survey) 2023, State Urban Development Departments, Census of India (2011).</p>
 
                <p><b>Introduction to Swachh Survekshan and Marking Criteria</b></p>
                </p>Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM): Launched in 2014, SBM is India's largest cleanliness drive aimed at eliminating open defecation, improving solid waste management, and ensuring sustainable sanitation infrastructure.
                   Swachh Survekshan: Conducted by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA), Swachh Survekshan assesses ULBs and states across various metrics, such as: Door-to-door waste collection, Source segregation of waste and Scientific processing and disposal of waste.

          State Management Information Systems (MIS):
          State MIS platforms are designed to provide real-time data on the performance of ULBs. The data is submitted by states themselves and serves as a critical input for central assessments.<p>

        <h2>Part II: State-wise Rankings in Swachh Survekshan</h2>     
        <p><b>Performace of States in Swachh Survekshan:</b>The rankings of states in Swachh Survekshan 2023 reflect their performance in achieving cleanliness and sanitation goals, evaluated across parameters such as waste management, infrastructure, and citizen engagement. States like Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Maharashtra, which scored above 4,500 marks, consistently performed well due to strong policy implementation and active citizen participation. Mid-performing states such as Punjab and Rajasthan scored between 3,500 to 4,000 marks, showcasing progress but highlighting gaps in infrastructure and resources. Low-performing states like Bihar and West Bengal, with scores below 3,000 marks, face challenges such as inconsistent data reporting, limited funding, and low awareness. These rankings not only encourage competitive federalism but also highlight areas needing targeted interventions to ensure equitable progress..</p>

<!-- Part III: Data Discrepancies -->
            <section>
    <div class="chart-description">
        <h2>Part III: Data Discrepancies </h2>
        <p> This section highlights the significant discrepancies in data reported by states through the Management Information System (MIS) and the results observed in the Swachh Survekshan 2023 cleanliness survey. The discrepancies are presented across three critical parameters.</p>
        <p>Part III: Key Areas of Discrepancy
1. Door-to-Door Waste Collection

Claimed Data:
States often report a high percentage of door-to-door waste collection, with coverage figures exceeding 95% or above in their Management Information System (MIS).
Survey Results:
On-ground data from Swachh Survekshan frequently reveals lower percentages of waste collection, particularly in smaller Urban Local Bodies (ULBs). This discrepancy points to gaps in operational execution, such as inadequate infrastructure, workforce shortages, and irregular collection schedules. Smaller ULBs often face capacity constraints, which contribute to the inconsistency between reported and actual figures.
2. Source Segregation of Waste

Claimed Data:
Many states claim that 90% or more of waste is being segregated at the source, demonstrating a strong commitment to sustainable waste management practices in their MIS reports.
Survey Results:
Swachh Survekshan assessments, however, indicate that actual segregation levels often fall below 60%. This mismatch highlights several underlying issues, including the lack of effective awareness campaigns to educate citizens about waste segregation, inadequate infrastructure such as separate bins or collection vehicles, and insufficient monitoring mechanisms to track segregation practices at the local level.
3. Waste Generation

Claimed Data:
Waste generation figures reported in MIS are sometimes significantly lower than actual estimates. This underreporting is often intentional, aimed at meeting efficiency targets and portraying better waste management outcomes.
Survey Results:
Swachh Survekshan data consistently shows higher waste generation figures than those claimed by states. This discrepancy stems from gaps in waste tracking systems, including the lack of reliable measurement tools and inconsistent data collection practices. Such underreporting can lead to inefficient allocation of resources, including treatment and disposal facilities.</p>

                <p>History shows that modern sewage systems in large cities like London and New York transformed public health by reducing diseases. Public health policy in India should prioritize improving sewage collection and treatment systems in urban and semi-urban areas to meet the goals of becoming an upper-middle-income country in the next decade.</p>
