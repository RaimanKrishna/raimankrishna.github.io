                <h2>Part I: Aim </h2>
                <p><b>Overview:</b> p>Swachh Survekshan (Cleanliness Survey), a flagship initiative under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), is an annual assessment designed to evaluate the performance of Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) and states across various sanitation and cleanliness parameters. The survey acts as a benchmark for monitoring urban sanitation, solid waste management, and citizens' perception of cleanliness, driving healthy competition among cities and states to improve their cleanliness standards.

                                      However, recurring discrepancies between data reported by State Management Information Systems (MIS) and the survey results have raised concerns about the transparency and accuracy of the assessment process. Such inconsistencies risk undermining the credibility of the initiative and may hinder the effectiveness of urban sanitation efforts.

                                      This project aims to identify and analyze these discrepancies, highlighting areas of concern and proposing solutions to strengthen the credibility, transparency, and impact of urban sanitation initiatives under the Swachh Bharat Mission (Clean India Mission).</p>

                <p>History shows that modern sewage systems in large cities like London and New York transformed public health by reducing diseases. Public health policy in India should prioritize improving sewage collection and treatment systems in urban and semi-urban areas to meet the goals of becoming an upper-middle-income country in the next decade.</p>
