                <h2>Part I: Aim </h2>
                <p><b>Overview:</b> <p>Swachh Survekshan (Cleanliness Survey),Swachh Survekshan, a key initiative under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), serves as an annual assessment that evaluates the cleanliness and sanitation performance of Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) and states. This survey plays a crucial role in monitoring urban sanitation, waste management practices, and citizen satisfaction regarding cleanliness. By driving healthy competition, it encourages cities and states to improve their cleanliness standards. However, recurring discrepancies between data reported by State Management Information Systems (MIS) and the actual findings from the survey have raised concerns regarding the transparency, accuracy, and overall effectiveness of the assessment process. These discrepancies, if not addressed, may diminish the credibility of the initiative and hinder its impact on urban sanitation efforts. This project seeks to identify, analyze, and propose solutions for these discrepancies, ultimately strengthening the credibility and effectiveness of urban sanitation initiatives under SBM.</p>
                
                 <p><b>Data:</b> Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban), Swachh Survekshan (Cleanliness Survey) 2023, State Urban Development Departments, Census of India (2011).</p>
 
                <p><b>Introduction to Swachh Survekshan and Marking Criteria</b></p>
                </p>Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM): Launched in 2014, SBM is India's largest cleanliness drive aimed at eliminating open defecation, improving solid waste management, and ensuring sustainable sanitation infrastructure.
                   Swachh Survekshan: Conducted by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA), Swachh Survekshan assesses ULBs and states across various metrics, such as: Door-to-door waste collection, Source segregation of waste and Scientific processing and disposal of waste.

          State Management Information Systems (MIS):
          State MIS platforms are designed to provide real-time data on the performance of ULBs. The data is submitted by states themselves and serves as a critical input for central assessments.<p>

        <h2>Part II: State-wise Rankings in Swachh Survekshan</h2>
        <p>The Swachh Survekshan 2023 rankings reflect states' performance in cleanliness, waste management, infrastructure, and citizen engagement. High-performing states like Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Maharashtra scored above 4,500 marks, thanks to strong policy implementation and citizen participation. Mid-performing states such as Punjab and Rajasthan scored between 3,500 to 4,000 marks, highlighting progress but also gaps in infrastructure. Low-performing states like Bihar and West Bengal, with scores below 3,000 marks, face challenges such as inconsistent data, limited funding, and low awareness. These rankings highlight areas that require focused interventions for equitable progress.</p>

        <h2>Part III: Data Discrepancies </h2>
        <p>Key discrepancies in Swachh Survekshan 2023 highlight gaps between State MIS data and survey results. States often report over 95% coverage in door-to-door waste collection, but actual figures are lower, especially in smaller ULBs, due to infrastructure and workforce issues. Similarly, while states claim 90% waste segregation, survey results show less than 60%, reflecting inadequate awareness and infrastructure. Waste generation is often underreported in MIS to meet efficiency targets, while survey data reveals higher actual generation, indicating gaps in tracking and data collection. These discrepancies hinder effective planning, resource allocation, and accountability.</p>

        <h2>Part IV: Analysis of Discrepancies in State Data</h2>
        <p><b>Least Discrepant States:</b></p>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Door-to-Door Collection:</b> Smaller states like Daman Diu and Chandigarh report more accurate data due to easier tracking and streamlined governance.</li>
    <li><b>Source Segregation:</b> States like Chandigarh, with focused waste segregation programs, show fewer discrepancies.</li>
    <li><b>Processing:</b> Integrated waste management systems in Chandigarh ensure accurate reporting.</li>
</ul>

        
<p><b>Most Discrepant States:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Door-to-Door Collection:</b> Larger states like Delhi and Andhra Pradesh face challenges due to geographical diversity and resource variations.</li>
    <li><b>Source Segregation:</b> States like Maharashtra and West Bengal have discrepancies due to inadequate infrastructure, especially in rural areas.</li>
    <li><b>Processing:</b> Resource-limited areas like Andaman and Nicobar struggle with waste processing, leading to reporting gaps.</li>

        <h2>Part V: Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The discrepancies between State MIS data and Swachh Survekshan 2023 findings highlight issues in transparency and data accuracy, affecting urban sanitation assessments under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM). Inaccurate reporting on door-to-door waste collection, source segregation, and waste generation complicates policymaking and resource allocation. The lack of independent audits, weak monitoring, and capacity issues in smaller ULBs exacerbate these discrepancies. To address this, independent audits, real-time monitoring, and capacity-building for ULBs are needed. By fixing these issues, SBM can ensure better accountability, resource allocation, and policy effectiveness, contributing to a cleaner and healthier India.</p>
