           This page acts as my project page for the PP434: Automated Data Visualisation for Policymaking course, part of the MPP programme at LSE. 
            Aims: The aim of this project is to analyze discrepancies between the claimed SBM data (door-to-door collection, segregation, and waste generation) and the Management Information System (MIS) data, and how these discrepancies correlate with the Swachh Survekshan rankings of states.

        <h2>Part I: Introduction</h2>
        <p><b>Overview:</b> Introduction to Swachh Survekshan and Marking Criteria</p>
        <p>
            Swachh Survekshan is an annual urban cleanliness survey under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), launched to encourage cities to improve sanitation and waste management practices. It ranks cities based on their performance, fostering healthy competition among urban local bodies (ULBs).
        </p>
        <h3>Evaluation Parameters</h3>
        <p>The survey uses a comprehensive framework with 9,500 marks, distributed across:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Service Level Progress (51%)</b>  
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Marks:</b> 4,830</li>
                    <li>Assesses waste collection, segregation, processing, and sustainable practices.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Certification (26%)</b>

                    <li><b>Marks:</b> 2,500</li>
                    <li>Includes certifications like ODF (Open Defecation Free) and Garbage-Free City ratings.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Citizens' Voice (23%)</b>  
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Marks:</b> 2,170</li>
                    <li>Evaluates citizen participation, awareness, and feedback on cleanliness initiatives.</li>

                <p>Under-five mortality (U5MR) is defined as the number of deaths per 1000 live births for children less than 5 years old. 
                Using data from the National Family Health Survey 4 (2019-20), this chart shows the wide variations in under-five mortality rates across different states with southern states like Kerala having lower mortality rates while northern states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar having above national average mortality.</p>

            <h2>Part III: Policy Response - Swachh Bharat Mission for increasing sanitation access across India.</h2>
                <p> History shows that installation of modern sewage systems in large cities like London and New York transformed the health of nations, by eliminating the spread on many diseases that thrive on poor sanitation and sewage. Attention of public health policy should shift to improving the sewage collection, treatment systems in urban, semi-urban and semi-rural areas of each state. Given that our goal is to become a upper middle income country in 5-7 years, and a high income country in 25 years, we need to develop State level grids for collecting, processing and recycling sewage and solid waste in the next ten years.</p>
