        <h2>Part I: Aim</h2>
        <p><b>Overview:</b> Swachh Survekshan, an annual assessment under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), evaluates the cleanliness and sanitation performance of Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) and states. It aims to improve urban sanitation, waste management, and citizen satisfaction. However, discrepancies between data reported by State Management Information Systems (MIS) and the actual survey findings raise concerns about transparency and accuracy. This project analyzes these discrepancies and proposes solutions to enhance SBM's credibility and impact.</p>
        
        <p><b>Data:</b> Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban), Swachh Survekshan 2023, State Urban Development Departments, Census of India (2011).</p>
        
        <p><b>Introduction to Swachh Survekshan and Marking Criteria:</b> SBM, launched in 2014, aims to eliminate open defecation, improve waste management, and ensure sustainable sanitation infrastructure. Swachh Survekshan, conducted by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA), assesses ULBs on door-to-door waste collection, source segregation, and waste disposal. State MIS platforms provide real-time data to support these assessments.</p>

        <h2>Part II: State-wise Rankings in Swachh Survekshan</h2>
        <p>The Swachh Survekshan 2023 rankings reflect states' performance in cleanliness, waste management, infrastructure, and citizen engagement. High-performing states like Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Maharashtra scored above 4,500 marks, thanks to strong policy implementation and citizen participation. Mid-performing states such as Punjab and Rajasthan scored between 3,500 to 4,000 marks, highlighting progress but also gaps in infrastructure. Low-performing states like Bihar and West Bengal, with scores below 3,000 marks, face challenges such as inconsistent data, limited funding, and low awareness. These rankings highlight areas that require focused interventions for equitable progress.</p>

        <h2>Part III: Data Discrepancies </h2>
        <p>Key discrepancies in Swachh Survekshan 2023 highlight gaps between State MIS data and survey results. States often report over 95% coverage in door-to-door waste collection, but actual figures are lower, especially in smaller ULBs, due to infrastructure and workforce issues. Similarly, while states claim 90% waste segregation, survey results show less than 60%, reflecting inadequate awareness and infrastructure. Waste generation is often underreported in MIS to meet efficiency targets, while survey data reveals higher actual generation, indicating gaps in tracking and data collection. These discrepancies hinder effective planning, resource allocation, and accountability.</p>

        <h2>Part IV: Analysis of Discrepancies in State Data</h2>
        <p><b>Least Discrepant States:</b></p>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Door-to-Door Collection:</b> Smaller states like Daman Diu and Chandigarh report more accurate data due to easier tracking and streamlined governance.</li>
    <li><b>Source Segregation:</b> States like Chandigarh, with focused waste segregation programs, show fewer discrepancies.</li>
    <li><b>Processing:</b> Integrated waste management systems in Chandigarh ensure accurate reporting.</li>
</ul>

        
<p><b>Most Discrepant States:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Door-to-Door Collection:</b> Larger states like Delhi and Andhra Pradesh face challenges due to geographical diversity and resource variations.</li>
    <li><b>Source Segregation:</b> States like Maharashtra and West Bengal have discrepancies due to inadequate infrastructure, especially in rural areas.</li>
    <li><b>Processing:</b> Resource-limited areas like Andaman and Nicobar struggle with waste processing, leading to reporting gaps.</li>

        <h2>Part V: Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The discrepancies between State MIS data and Swachh Survekshan 2023 findings highlight issues in transparency and data accuracy, affecting urban sanitation assessments under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM). Inaccurate reporting on door-to-door waste collection, source segregation, and waste generation complicates policymaking and resource allocation. The lack of independent audits, weak monitoring, and capacity issues in smaller ULBs exacerbate these discrepancies. To address this, independent audits, real-time monitoring, and capacity-building for ULBs are needed. By fixing these issues, SBM can ensure better accountability, resource allocation, and policy effectiveness, contributing to a cleaner and healthier India.</p>
