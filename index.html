            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                With over seven years of experience in government advisory and public policy,I work as a Manager at KPMG, specializing in urban development and governance projects. As part of a USAID project, I supported the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs and the Uttar Pradesh government in policymaking, as well as in designing and implementing impactful WASH initiatives under the Clean India Mission
            </p>
            <p>
                I have contributed to key projects, including the Swachh Bharat Mission 2.0, where I helped shape policies for used water management and facilitated innovation through the Swachh Technology Challenge. Additionally, I played a pivotal role in the Global Investor Summit 2023, assisting in startup screening, due diligence, and funding linkages to promote sustainable urban solutions.

            <p>
                Currently pursuing an MPP (2024/25) at LSE, I aim to enhance my expertise in evidence-based policymaking and technical skills like data visualization to support effective governance. Beyond work, I enjoy exploring political history and nature.
