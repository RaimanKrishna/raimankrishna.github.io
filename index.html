            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                With over seven years of experience in government advisory and public policy, I currently work as a Manager at KPMG, specializing in urban development and governance projects. My work has focused on collaborating with the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs and the Uttar Pradesh government to design and implement impactful initiatives.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have contributed to key projects, including the Swachh Bharat Mission 2.0, where I helped shape policies for used water management and facilitated innovation through the Swachh Technology Challenge. Additionally, I played a pivotal role in the Global Investor Summit 2023, assisting in startup screening, due diligence, and funding linkages to promote sustainable urban solutions.

            <p>
                Currently pursuing an MPP (2024/25) at LSE, I aim to enhance my expertise in evidence-based policymaking and technical skills like data visualization to support effective governance. Beyond work, I enjoy exploring political history and nature.
