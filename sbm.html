                <h2>Part I: Introduction</h2>
                <p><b>Objectives:</b> This project aims to analyse the relationship between child mortality outcomes in children (under five) across Indian states and various factors that may infleunce it such as malnutrition, women's education and improved access to sanitation (government intervention).
                    The questions for analysis are "Which indicators of child and maternal health along with sanitation infleunce child mortality and to what extent?" and "How has India progressed on child health outcomes across time and regions"?.
              <p><b>Data:</b> National Family Health Surveys (NFHS) from (NFHS) 1-5 (1992-2021) and the Census of India (2011). Option to use API is there in
                <a href="https://www.data.gov.in/search?title=NFHS%20%205%20sanitation&type=resources&sortby=changed">Open Data Government Platform India</a>.

                  <p><b>Challenges:</b> Data cleaning challenges included handling missing values, inconsistent formats, and large datasets.NFHS 1 and 2 data are available only in PDFs which had to be scraped out.
                  There were more than 135 columns in NFHS 5 dataset from which relevant data was extracted. Python tools like Pandas helped tidy the data efficiently and conducted correlation and regression analysis in Google Co-Lab. Links are given below in each part.<br>
            It was also difficult to get the exact geojson base map of India with correct sub-national and national administrative boundaries of India as new states and Union Territories have been formed. <a href="https://simplemaps.com/gis/country/in#admin1">Simple Maps</a> was used.

 <div class="chart-description">
<p><b>Interpretation:</b>A moderate negative correlation exists between child malnutrition and improved sanitation. Poor sanitation exacerbates tropical enteropathy, a condition causing chronic intestinal inflammation, disrupting nutrient absorption, impairing growth, and weakening immunity in children.</p>

                <h2> PartIII: Linking Child Mortality with Health and Education Indicators</h2>
                <h3> Regression Model </h3>
                <p> Simple linear regression model is contructed:
                <center>U5MR_i = β_0 + β_1(Women with 10+ years of schooling_i) + β_2(Improved sanitation facility_i)+ β_3(Below normal BMI Women_i) + β_4(Stunted_i) + β_5(Wasted_i) + β_6(Underweight_i) +  β_7(Children with diarrhoea taken to a health facility_i) + ϵ_i</center><br><br>
   <b>Dependent Variable:</b> U5MR_i: Under-five mortality rate for state_i, defined as deaths per 1000 live births for children under 5.<br>
<b>Independent Variables for state_i:</b>Women’s education, sanitation, maternal health (below normal BMI), % of stunted, wasted, underweight children; and diarrhoea care access (proxy for health access and diarrhoea is 3rd leading cause of child mortality.
<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/643462/leading-causes-of-death-among-children-india/">Statista- Causes of Death of Children India</a><br>

<b>Coefficients:</b>β_0, β_1, β_2, β_3, β_4, β_5, β_6 are parameters to be estimated.<br><br>

<b>Assumptions:</b>Linear relationship. Errors are independently and identically distributed. <br><br>

<p><b>Analytical Framework:</b> Simple OLS regression of the filtered NFHS 5 dataset and estimating the coefficients - <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JsxaxJvW9_-m5USM0_YIZ_0engWJrA8y?usp=sharing">Google CoLab Project Regression Notebook</a> (OpenAI, 2025).
Based on this regression, a trellis chart is created which depicts the regression of U5MR for state_i on independent variables that represent indicators of sanitation, child health, women's education and health. </p>

<div class="chart-description">
<p><b>Interpretation:</b><br>
<b>R-squared (0.731):</b> 73.1% of the variability in under-five mortality is explained by the model, indicating a good fit.<br>
<b>Significant Estimates:</b> Four variables are significant at the 10% level (due to small sample size), on average:<br>
<b>- Women (15-49) with 10+ years of schooling (%): β_1 = -0.3311</b> Higher female education associated with reduced under-five mortality.<br>
<b>- Improved sanitation (%): β_2 = -0.2611</b> Greater access to sanitation associated with lower under-five mortality.<br>
<b>- Women with BMI <18.5 (%): β_3 = 1.3275</b> Poor maternal nutrition associated with increased under-five mortality.<br>
<b>- Stunted children (%): β_4 = 1.0098</b> Higher stunting rates associated with increased under-five mortality.<br>
<p><b>Limitations:</b> Omitted variable bias and lack of state-specific or time-invariant fixed effects.</p>

A <b>class of 'aspirational states'</b>—Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, and union territories like Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu—are rapidly progressing yet remain behind key policy targets.
The state of Meghalaya is an <b>outlier</b> in stunting while performing better in other indicators, warranting further investigation.</p>

            <h2>Part VI: Conclusion </h2>
 <h3>Summary and Policy Recommendations</h3>
<p>Women’s education and health significantly reduce under-five mortality, while improved sanitation reduces disease exposure, addressing tropical enteropathy and improving child survival. Stunted children face higher risks of disease-related mortality, and regional disparities persist in sanitation and nutrition, with 'aspirational states' catching up.
The potential impact of other variables such as economic development (per capita state GDP), efficiency of public food distribution systems and availability of pediatricians on child mortality can be examined further.
To meet SDGs on child health and sanitation by 2030, India should <b>boost women’s education</b>, especially in aspirational states, <b>enhance sanitation quality</b> and waste management, and <b>strengthen maternal health</b> alongside community nutrition programmes to reduce stunting and improve child survival.</p>
